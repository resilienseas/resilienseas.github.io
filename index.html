<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Ocean Acidification Monitoring Gaps and Hotspots</h1>

</div>


<p>Ocean Acidification (OA) is progressing on the West Coast of North America at a rate 2x higher than the global average. However, with enhanced monitoring and evaluation, marine managers can be better prepared to understand how OA is changing regionally, and creating effects locally.</p>
<div id="the-monitoring-inventory" class="section level2">
<h2>The Monitoring Inventory</h2>
<p>The West Coast Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia (OAH) Monitoring Inventory is a joint project of the Pacific Coast Collaborative and the Interagency Working Group on Ocean Acidification (OA). It emerged as a project to identify and catalog all monitoring assets along the West Coast that are measuring metrics of OAH. The assets are owned and operated with different priorities by different institutions, but are brought together in an attempt to analyze how well we understand and are monitoring OA trends at a regional level.</p>

<h2>Gap Analysis</h2>
<p>A main recommendation of the West Coast OAH Panel is that a gap analysis be conducted on the combined regional monitoring network. This is crucial for identifying areas of future research and priorities for expanding the network. This gap analysis shows gaps across the entire network. This analysis was completed again with subsets of the inventory for high frequency monitoring and carbonate complete monitoring to highlight gaps in priority data types.</p>

This assumes it is ideal to increase monitoring where current monitoring is sparse or conditions may be more variable. “Severe gaps” represent the top 0.1% of model results, representing greatest relative distance and greatest relative variability.</p>
