## Identifying Ocean Acidification Monitoring Gaps and Hotspots in the California Current System

Ocean Acidification (OA) is progressing on the West Coast of North America at a rate 2x higher than the global average. However, with enhanced monitoring and evaluation, marine managers can be better prepared to understand how OA is changing regionally, and creating effects locally.

## Add Interactive Map

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  fitBounds(-119, 34, -199.5, 34.5) %>% 
  setView(-119.8422, 34.4132, zoom = 17)
```
