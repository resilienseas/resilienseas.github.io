Measures were made with a Hydrolab DS4a/DS5x logging probe at half hour intervals during spring-late summer in each year. Submitted data were collected through August 2010. The probe was deployed at biweekly-monthly intervals with cleaning and calibration done in a 12-24 hr period before probe redeployment. The probe was secured to the shoreline of Tatoosh Island and was housed in a 5000 l tidepool separated from the ocean by a 1 wide lip at a tide height of 80 cm to assure that probe performance was not compromised by desiccation at low tide. These data form the core of analyses in Pfister et al. (L&O 2007) Wootton et al.
